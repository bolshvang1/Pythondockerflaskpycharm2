# Project Description
This project is a homework assignment to teach how to get Pycharm setup with Docker, Flask, MySQL, and Postman

- This project is a website that consists of a database of Robert Deniro Movies that allow you to edit the records.
- I created a login requirement that requires a Username and Password in order to access or edit the records
- Below are my screenshots with Descriptions

---

### This is my Login Screen that comes up when you go to http://localhost:5000 after running the program on your local computer
- You are unable to access any other webpage that allows you to view, add, edit, or delete the records without a successful login
- A flash message appears that welcomes you to the website and asks for you to login in order to proceed
- You may close out of this flash message but an incorrect username/password or trying to access a different page will reroute you to the Login page with the flash message again

- This is the Login Screen showing that you are able to close out of the flash message

### The Username is readable and the Password is protected as you insert them into the field

### After a successful Login, you are routed to a Profile page that Welcomes you to the Website 
- The Profile Page contains a flash message that alerts you that you have Logged in successfully. You may close out of this flash message as well.
- The Profile Page welcomes the user according to their username and contains a message welcoming them to the site
- After you have reached the Profile page, you now have access to the Nav Bar and are able to view, add, edit, or delete the records
